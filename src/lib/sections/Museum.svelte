<Paragraph>
  Last, but certainly not least, I want to discuss the very site you are on
  right now. The intention is to have several implementations in different UI
  frameworks both as a quick way to learn a bunch of technologies and as a
  demonstration of their performance against each other on a simple two page
  website.

<Paragraph>
  This museum implementation is built using Sveltekit. For styling it uses
  TailwindCSS. It is deployed using Cloudflare Pages. I had never used Svelte
  before and liked it much more than I expected to. Truly, I had an excellent
  experience with all of these technologies and may use them again on future
  projects.
